You could age yourself three decades; you could see yourself imagined as another ethnicity; you could swap your gender; you could become thinner, or bald.	2023-01-11T10:00:08+0000	Magazine	Magazine	News	1257

And one of the biggest crypto exchanges collapsed. 	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/business/the-week-in-business-layoffs-meta.html	What began as a pause in hiring at Meta escalated into mass layoffs last week, with the companyâs founder, Mark Zuckerberg, culling more than 11,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of the work force. He said the company, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, had grown too quickly during the pandemic, when a boom in online commerce lifted many tech companies. The layoffs were the latest in a string of cuts and hiring freezes across the industry.

504	âThe Playlistâ resembles other TV dramas that follow founders to their eventual comeuppance â except Spotify isnât facing any messy implosion.	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/magazine/the-playlist-netflix-spotify.html	Daniel Ek, a founder of Spotify and its current chief executive, sits in front of a U.S. Senate committee hearing. Or rather: A Swedish actor playing Ek sits in front of a Senate hearing, as imagined by a Swedish production designer. A fictitious senator named Landy is grilling him, hard. âYour business model just doesnât work for musicians, does it?â she asks. Her tone makes it obvious that she already knows the answer Ek would give if he were willing to tell the truth. As she peppers him with facts and figures about Spotifyâs market share and artistsâ measly cut of its revenue, Ek tries to fight back, insisting that his streaming service, whatever its shortcomings, is still the best path forward for musicians hoping to make a living from their art. But the more Landy presses, the more shaken Ek looks, as though he didnât expect the questioning to be so tough. There is a moment in which it seems he might be considering the possibility that her criticisms have merit: Maybe, despite all of his companyâs rhetoric about freedom for artists, he really is just a new breed of music-industry monopolist.	2022-11-02T09:00:13+0000	Magazine	Magazine	News	1219

He had been trying for months to back out of the $44 billion deal, accusing Twitter of misleading him about the number of spam accounts on its platform. The dispute was set to be litigated in Delaware Chancery Court this month and promised to be a messy affair for both sides. More than a hundred subpoenas had dragged Silicon Valleyâs elite into the litigation, and text messages sent among Mr. Musk and his friends and business associates emerged this month, revealing a clash between the billionaire and Twitterâs leadership. But the tumult is not over. The judge overseeing the case granted a request from Mr. Muskâs lawyers to delay the Delaware trial, giving him three weeks to complete the purchase, and, as with all things Musk, the situation could become more complicated still.	2022-10-09T11:00:04+0000	SundayBusiness	Business Day	News	939

Powell, the Fed chair, has indicated that there is little that would sway the central bank from its path of raising rates, including at its Sept. 20-21 meeting.	2022-09-04T17:54:34+0000	Business	Business Day	News	957

743	HUNDREDS of disputes are in progress over who owns valuable business domain names on the Internet -- those ubiquitous acme.com identifiers for E-mail addresses and corporate Web sites. This long-brewing controversy has pitted owners of domain names afraid of losing their names against trademark owners who contend that their marks are being compromised. And both sides now are clamoring for someone to do something. Someone, in this case, is Internic, an organization serving as the registry for the most recognized categories of Internet domains: .com, for commercial enterprises; .edu, for educational institutions; .net, for organizations that run networks, and .org, for research and nonprofit groups. Internic has registered some 400,000 names in these domains, first-come, first-served, since it was founded in 1993 through an arrangement with the federally backed National Science Foundation.          Last year Internic began charging registrants $50 a year for each name registered. Previously, Internet name disputes were rare and, invariably, had been settled cooperatively. But as commercial interest in the Internet increased, domain-name speculators and trademark lawyers descended like locusts. Speculators staked out names of well-known companies and products and began selling them back to the companies themselves. Trademark holders began sending threats to holders of domain names that came close to, or matched, their trademarks. If the domain holders didn't relinquish, the trademark owners often  would sue -- even if the trademark was for Acme Plumbing, say, and the registered name holder's business, Acme Bakery, was unrelated. And if threats didn't work, many trademark holders were also happy to threaten Internic. Their lawyers say, 'We'll sue everyone, including you,'  said Grant  Clark, corporate counsel for the Science Applications International Corporation, which owns Internic and the company that operates it, Network Solutions Inc. According to Internic, such threats have forced it to assume that it will be sued in such circumstances -- despite the fact that Internic lawyers say it has  never performed, nor does it intend to, any kind of trademark search or verification before issuing a domain name. To deflect some of its perceived liability, Internic adopted a name-dispute policy that appears to favor trademark holders. The policy so infuriated holders of existing domain names that the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public policy group, is actively seeking pro bono counsel to file a class action suit against both Network Solutions Inc. and the Federal Government. It's not clear how much of an effect such a suit might have. Although Internic's name registry was formed with the blessing of the National Science Foundation, Internic has no known legal authority. It was given its responsibility by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, a clearinghouse chartered by the influential Internet Society and the Federal Network Council to coordinate how domain names are linked to the physical locations of computers on the global network. In any event, one worrisome feature for groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation is a contract that Internic requires domain-name applicants to sign.  The contract says they must agree not to sue Internic over a name dispute. And in the event of a dispute, they must post a bond to cover Internic's legal fees. The amount of the bond, according to a lawyer for Network Solutions, could be little or nothing if the company is not named in the suit, though if the company is named, it would be higher. Another concern is that Internic overwhelmingly favors trademark owners over those with registered domain names. A trademark holder must simply inform Internic of a registered trademark that predates the registration of an Internet domain name and contend that the duplication is causing confusion or harm. These two conditions are sufficient grounds for Internic to start a dispute proceeding against the existing holder of the domain name. At the end of 30 days, the name goes dark, or is taken off the network pending an agreement between the name holder and the trademark owner. Going dark, of course, could put a network provider, or anyone who conducts business on the Internet, out of business overnight. One such unresolved dispute involves the domain name sylvan.com, registered with Internic by Kayvan Sylvan, a software consultant. His domain name is being  challenged by Sylvan Learning Systems Inc., which sells franchised educational services. If Mr. Sylvan and the company are unable to settle the dispute in the allotted time, Internic will take the sylvan.com address off the Internet until the matter is finally resolved. Internic contends that its only alternative would be the dubious one of waiting for Sylvan Learning to slap it with a lawsuit for contributing to a trademark infringement. The logical solution to this industry problem would be to indemnify Internic from trademark liability so that name disputes could be settled directly between the parties involved, through existing trademark law. Such legal protection would have to come from the Federal Communications Commission or from Congress.  Mr. Clark, the lawyer for Internic's corporate parent, said he would be ecstatic if Congress granted his organization immunity from lawsuits accusing  it of contributing to trademark infringement. It would put an end to the need for the dispute policy, he said. Even Internic's biggest detractors agree. By whatever means, Internic needs to  get out of the business of deciding who will have their domain name taken away, says Carl Oppedahl, a lawyer who had sued Internic on behalf of clients who wanted to challenge its dispute policy. If a trademark owner doesn't like a domain name, it should go to the courts. Existing trademark law applies to the Internet, just like it does to toothpaste brands in stores.         	https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/business/technology.html	HUNDREDS of disputes are in progress over who owns valuable business domain names on the Internet -- those ubiquitous acme.com identifiers for E-mail addresses and corporate Web sites.

Speaking at the company's developer conference in San Jose, Calif., Paul S. Otellini, the president of Intel, demonstrated a prototype of a hand-held device called the Universal Communicator that is based on an Intel processor and can automatically switch between Wi-Fi and cellular networks. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., also disclosed plans to produce powerful chips that can function as multiple processors. Mr. Otellini demonstrated one such chip, code-named Vanderpool, which will eventually allow users to partition their PC processor to run two operations at once, like a television program and a 3-D computer game. The company plans its first dual-core processor in 2005. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)	2003-09-17T05:00:00+0000	Business/Financial Desk	Business Day	News	144

795	E-COMMERCE SYNOPSYS TO BUY NUMERICAL TECHNOLOGIES Synopsys Inc. has agreed to buy Numerical Technologies Inc. for $250 million, or $7 a share, the companies announced yesterday. The acquisition price represents an 89.2 percent premium, based on Numerical's closing price of $3.70 a share on Friday. Shares of Numerical, which is based in San Jose, Calif., closed yesterday at $6.91, up $3.21, or about 87 percent. Chip-making companies use Numerical's software and other applications to produce integrated circuits with patterns that are smaller than the wavelength of light. Numerical's applications are based on phase-shifting and optical correction technologies that compensate for distortions caused by working in such reduced dimensions. Synopsys, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., makes electronic design automation software. The company expects the deal to speed production of sub-wavelength chips as well as reduce costs and manufacturing risk for customers developing power-efficient integrated circuits. The acquisition requires regulatory approval and other closing conditions. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter.

The stock fell as much as 15 percent. Sales in the fourth quarter ending March 31 will total $164 million to $166 million, and profit will be about 17 cents a share, the company said. Microchip Technology had projected sales would be little changed from the $171 million of the third quarter and predicted profit of 18 cents. Businesses and consumers are spending less on automobiles and office products that use the chips as war looms in Iraq and tensions rise in the Korean peninsula, the company said. Sales in Korea will fall more than 20 percent, pushing revenue in Asia down 8 percent from the third quarter. The reduction could signal tough times ahead for rival chip makers, analysts said. Microchip Technology shares fell after the report, dropping as much as $3.48, to $20.26 in after-hours trading.

Richard Wolpert, left, a board member of MusicNet, said a preview of its service would be offered for journalists and industry analysts next week.

833	Shares in Liberate Technologies, interactive television software maker, fall 7.58 percent after company says its results will be poorer than expected because of internal financial restructuring and lower spending among its cable and telecommunications customers; chief executive Mitchell Kertzman comments; graph (S)	https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/30/business/technology-briefing-telecommunications-liberate-technologies-shares-fall.html	Shares in Liberate Technologies, the interactive television software maker, fell 7.58 percent yesterday after the company said its results would be poorer than expected because of internal financial restructuring and lower spending among its cable and telecommunications customers. The company, based in San Carlos, Calif., now expects a pro forma loss before amortization and other charges for its fiscal first quarter of 12 cents to 19 cents a share instead of the loss of 6 cents to 8 cents it had forecast in its last earnings announcement. 'It is a difficult market,' Mitchell Kertzman, Liberate's chief executive, said. 'You've seen enough of that from the cable firms, with weaker spending.' Demand for Liberate's advanced television software has lagged as telecommunications companies retrench after their late-1990's spending spree. In a statement, Mr. Kertzman said that Liberate would be able to turn a profit, minus charges, in the second half of its current fiscal year. The company said it expected to have $240 million in cash and equivalents eventually. Liberate shares fell 16 cents, to $1.95.

The company, which is based in Durham, N.C., said it expected revenue growth of 8 percent to 11 percent in the quarter, ending June 30. That was up from a previous estimate of 5 percent. But Cree said it expected to post a net loss in the fourth quarter. The company said it planned to write down the value of investments in publicly traded companies that have declined. It estimated the charge at $17 million after tax. Shares of Cree closed at $12.67.Â Â  (Dow Jones) DEALS NOVELL BUYS SILVERSTREAM Novell, a maker of network software, said yesterday that it would acquire SilverStream Software for $9 a share, or $212 million. That price reflected a 43 percent premium above Friday's closing price of $5.14. SilverStream, based in Billerica, Mass., makes software that permits different computing systems to interact online. Once the deal is done, SilverStream will become a Novell unit and its Extend product line will be rebranded under the Novell name. Novell said the acquisition should add about 1 percent to total revenue in 2002. Shares in SilverStream rose $3.76, or 73 percent, to close at $8.90.

Jim Whitney, a spokesman for AOL Time Warner, declined to comment, but Wall Street analysts and some employees said they expected layoffs to begin this week. The cuts would be the second major round of layoffs this year at the company, the world's largest Internet and media company. The company cut about 2,400 jobs in January. John Corcoran, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, who met with J. Michael Kelly, AOL Time Warner's chief financial officer, on Friday, said that the company was looking to cut costs in its cable and music divisions. Mr. Corcoran said he had no specific knowledge of layoffs and maintained a strong buy on the stock. Last month, Gerald M. Levin, chief executive of AOL Time Warner, said that advertising revenue was stabilizing and that he did not expect to make specific layoffs.

The megabit RAM is an awesomely powerful memory chip capable of storing more than one million bits of information - enough to fill roughly four of these newspaper pages with type this size - on a sliver of silicon the size of a dime.	https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/business/technology.html	Japanese Lead In RAM Race	1984-02-02T05:00:00+0000	Financial Desk	Business Day	News	826

1027	Editorial reflects on role of ever-advancing technology in new millennium; says rate of change in world is dizzying, yet there is no evidence that human nature has altered in last thousand years, or even since human history began	https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/03/opinion/the-limits-of-technology.html	Amusing as it is simply to sit back and watch the calendar of the Western world flip over, it is reasonable to expect that 1999 -- prologue to a new millennium -- will yield some themes that ask for real reflection. Here is one. In the blizzard of commentary already blowing in, it is becoming apparent that we are nearly blinded by technology. Trying to gauge the meaning of a new millennium, we almost instinctively do so by marveling at the rate of technological change, which we cannot help believing will only increase. It seems like the most salient feature of human culture during the last 200 years.	1999-01-03T05:00:00+0000	Editorial Desk	Opinion	Editorial	463
1028	  ABOUT 12 years ago, a major shift took place in the complex technology used in integrated circuits: Computer chips using a new technology known as metal-oxide-semiconductor, or MOS, started gaining a greater share of the market at the expense of chips using an older technology known as bipolar.   The change had profound effects on products and corporate fortunes. MOS technology helped make possible new types of complex chips, such as the microprocessors used in personal computers and high-capacity memories. And those companies that were able to exploit the new technology were able to rise to prominence. One such company was the Intel Corporation, in which the International Business Machines Corporation yesterday bought a 12 percent stake. Another even named itself after the technology - the Mostek Corporation.	https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/23/business/technology.html	ABOUT 12 years ago, a major shift took place in the complex technology used in integrated circuits: Computer chips using a new technology known as metal-oxide-semiconductor, or MOS, started gaining a greater share of the market at the expense of chips using an older technology known as bipolar.	1982-12-23T05:00:00+0000	Financial Desk	Business Day	News	854

First-quarter sales and profit, excluding certain items, will be unchanged from the preceding period, beating analysts' forecasts, the chief financial officer, Marcel Gani, said. Juniper, which trails Cisco Systems in sales of data-traffic routers, had losses in five of the six preceding quarters as customers slashed spending after overbuilding fiber optic networks. Shares of Juniper dropped 33 cents, to $8.90, in after-hours trading. Earlier, shares fell 46 cents, to $9.23, in regular trading.

Sites including Microsoft.com, MSN.com, MSNBC.com, WindowsMedia.com, Expedia.com and Carpoint.com were unavailable nearly 24 hours. The problem also crippled some of the company's European Web sites.

Revenue fell 13.2 percent from a year ago, to $3.80 billion, excluding revenue from the QwestDex directories business that Qwest is selling. The decline will be reported later in a final filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission as just under 10 percent once Qwest completes a restatement of 2001 revenue. Qwest has said that the 2001 quarter's revenue were inflated by improper accounting of sales of capacity on its optical network. No matter which figures are used, they add up to continued weakness and Qwest said that revenue for the year would end up at the low end of the range it previously projected. But Qwest's operating units did manage to generate $53 million more cash than they used by cutting costs and capital spending. Â Â Barnaby J.

1097	HARDWARE QUANTUM TO CUT JOBS Quantum, a maker of com- puter data-storage devices, said yesterday that it would reduce its work force by 1,100 as its new chief executive, Richard Belluzzo, sought to pare costs and return to profitability by March 2003. About 80 percent of the workers cut will be hired by Jabil Circuit Inc., which is taking over some Quantum manufacturing, a spokeswoman said. The job cuts and other restructuring costs will trim earnings by $100 million in the second and third quarters, Quantum said. Mr. Belluzzo said last month that he planned to tighten Quantum's spending and increase sales of products that were more profitable than hardware systems, like services and software, amid a slump in demand for corporate technology. The shares of the company, based in Milpitas, Calif., fell 21 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $3.01.

1099	TELECOMMUNICATIONS MOTOROLA PREDICTS RISE IN SALES Motorola Inc., the world's second-biggest mobile telephone maker, said that consumers worldwide would buy 430 million to 440 million handsets in 2003 as demand increases for the first time in three years. About 400 million cellphones were purchased last year, Mike S. Zafirovski, president of Motorola, said. The forecast is in line with his statement this month that worldwide sales will rise 8 percent to 10 percent this year. Some analysts and investors have said the company's newest models will not be competitive enough to take sales from rivals like Nokia and Samsung. Motorola said that first-quarter profit would miss forecasts as margins lag analysts' estimates. Motorola reported its first consecutive quarters of net income in two years as fourth-quarter sales rose 3.2 percent, beating forecasts.

Senator Hatch, a Utah Republican who will be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 20, made his remarks at the opening of a conference sponsored by the Coalition for the Future of Music.

1156	I.B.M. thinks it can make real, predictable improvements in technology services.	https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/blogs/26bits-a-moores4687.html	Could there be a kind of Moore's Law that would cover predictable advancement in complex technology consulting services?  It's a question that people familiar with the services business might find comical and perplexing. Services engagements are called engagements for a reason. They're often one-off hand-holding proposals with indefinite ends.   So it seems tough for a company to claim any type of consistent improvement in services performance where a client could expect to see, say, twice as much efficiency every couple of years.   But I.B.M. -- who else? -- believes a Moore's Law equivalent is achievable with so-called service systems. And the man pushing the idea is Jim Spohrer, the director of services research at I.B.M.'s Almaden research facility in San Jose, Calif.   That's right. Here comes Spohrer's Law.   In industry parlance, a service system could be anything from a company to a university, a government body or a water management plant. It's really any type of semi-complex organization.   I.B.M.'s big push these days revolves around making these types of service systems smarter. You may have seen the ads.   Mr. Spohrer estimates that the planet holds about six trillion service systems, and I.B.M. wants to find out how they all interact. Rather bluntly, I.B.M. would like to create a computer model of all the service systems and begin running algorithms across the model to determine, for example, how a change in the price of toasters in China affects people in other countries who supply the metal used for the toaster's paneling, and others who produce the plastic, and so on.   We build these very, very complex systems, and they have these unintended consequences we didn't foresee, Mr. Spohrer said. We have to design systems that are more self-correcting and that can learn.  With something like water management, I.B.M. argues that it could start off by trying to make sure that a given system worked well and that purification processes functioned as expected. With that job done, I.B.M. could then turn to look at how people's use of things like dishwashers and washing machines matched up with energy prices, and try to offer advice on when people should run such devices. Further out, Mr. Spohrer said, I.B.M. could dig into how the water management system affected local ecosystems: Are the frogs and the fish happy?   The bigger idea here is that I.B.M. could try to put some type of measurement around the short-term and long-term effects of changes to a service system.   The Moore's Law part will be about increasing the percent of win-win interactions, Mr. Spohrer said.  He points to the global financial meltdown as proof that the world's financial service systems are now tightly interwoven.   By studying such interactions and making quick changes, I.B.M. proposes that it could help smooth out the ups and downs of market shifts.   Such talk sounds borderline techno-utopian, although Mr. Spohrer dismisses that notion.   It isn't that I have a perfect model, and everything is going to be perfect, he said. It's that there is quite a bit of anarchy and uncertainty, but we can still make statistical statements about these systems and how quickly they can recover.  I.B.M. has about 500 people dedicated to services research and has tested out some of its ideas on the company's own business.   For example, I.B.M.'s researchers developed an automated system for improving large online technology purchases. While about 90 percent of the orders are button-pushing affairs, some of the more complex deals require customers to enter specific information about the products and services they want. Some of I.B.M.'s services software would use semantic and syntactic checks to review the customer orders.   We could flag things that customers didn't do properly, Mr. Spohrer said. Using this technology, you can shift revenue forward on the order of $100 million per year because mistakes with the complex deals often take time to resolve. 	2009-03-26T11:01:21+0000	None	Blogs	Web Log	643

Nintendo said yesterday that it had shipped 12 million of its GameCube consoles, which cost less and are popular among younger children. The PlayStation 2's installed base is largest in North America, where there are 11.3 million, followed by Japan, with 9.9 million, and Europe, with 8.8 million. Sony has shipped four million PlayStation 2's in the last three months alone, matching Microsoft's most optimistic shipment estimates for its Xbox during the company's entire fiscal year, which ends June 30. The Xbox, which hit the market in November, has sold well in North America but struggled in Europe and especially in Japan. Earlier this week, Microsoft said recent price cuts had lifted Xbox sales in Europe, but it released no sales figures. Chris Gaither (NYT) 	2002-05-10T05:00:00+0000	Technology	Technology	News	1565

1161	INTERNET RETRENCHMENT AT CMGI CMGI , the once-highflying Internet investment and holding company, told investors yesterday that it would not be able to meet its revenue and cash-use targets for the balance of its fiscal year ending July 31, as many of its units continue to restructure and lay off employees. Yesterday, its Alta Vista search engine for the World Wide Web eliminated 200 jobs, 25 percent of its staff. It cut 225 jobs in September. CMGI also said it would close ExchangePath, an Internet payments company. On Wednesday, Engage, CMGI's Internet advertising unit, said it no longer expected to break even in its fourth quarter. Engage is cutting 550 jobs, half its work force. CMGI suspended its forecasts of annual revenue of $1.65 billion and a 30 percent profit margin. For the current quarter, which ends Jan. 31, the company expects revenue of $335 million to $345 million. That would be the second consecutive decrease in revenue. The company said it expected to use up $300 million to $400 million of its $1 billion in cash and securities by July 31.

1169	Technology Briefing: Information Technology Spending Will Ri	https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/22/business/technology-briefing-e-commerce-information-technology-spending-will-rise.html	Gartner DataQuest Inc., a unit of Gartner Inc., predicted yesterday that worldwide information technology spending by corporations will increase 5 percent in 2003 from a year ago. In a news release, the market research firm said sales of technology would reach $2.1 trillion worldwide this year; previously, DataQuest forecast a low single-digit increase on a percentage basis in technology outlays in 2003. According to DataQuest, the industries that will spend the most in 2003 and 2004 on technology are government and health care, although levels will be modest. DataQuest estimates that information technology spending will increase only in the single digits in percentage terms in both industries. 'Key issues that are increasing technology investments will include homeland security, outsourcing, and agency modernization projects,' an analyst, Rishi Sood, said. In health care, DataQuest said patient safety, the rising costs of delivering and managing health care, and regulatory requirements will drive information technology spending.	2003-01-22T05:00:00+0000	Business/Financial Desk	Business Day	News	152
1162	HARDWARE I.B.M. REPORTS $515 MILLION IN LOSSES I.B.M. said yesterday that for the last five quarters it booked an after-tax loss of $515 million from its discontinued hard-disk-drive operations. The added disclosure came in a regulatory filing a week ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings announcement, when it had planned to release the information for the year-earlier period, and at a time when investors are examining all financial statements closely. I.B.M. has been under pressure to provide more financial disclosure for the last six months as investors have increasingly questioned the quality of the company's earnings. According to the filing, I.B.M.'s hard-disk-drive operations subtracted $92 million from net income in the first quarter of 2002 and $423 million for the four quarters of 2001. I.B.M. said that net income after discontinued operations was $7.713 billion in 2001 and $1.192 billion in the first quarter of 2002. Â Â (Reuters) SOFTWARERETEK SHARES PLUNGE AFTER FORECAST REVISION Shares in Retek, a Minneapolis-based maker of retailing software, plunged yesterday after the company said that its quarterly revenue would not meet previous forecasts. For its third quarter the company said it now expected per-share operating earnings of 2 to 4 cents, software licensing revenue of $36 million to $38 million and total revenue of $52 million to $54 million. Wall Street analysts were expecting total revenue of $59.6 million. Steve Ladwig, chief executive of Retek, said in a statement, We are disappointed with the volume of new business signed in the second quarter, although we expect that most of the business that was pushed out of the second quarter will be closed later this year. In the wake of the announcement, SWS Securities, SunTrust, USB Piper Jaffray and CSFB downgraded the company's stock. Shares in Retek dropped $10.85, or 62.6 percent, to close at $6.46.

1164	Technology Brie	https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/27/business/technology/technology-briefing-hardware-technology-job-market-weak.html	The job market in the technology industry remained weak but stabilized last year, according to the American Electronics Association. In a yearly report based on government data and released this week, the trade group found that the technology industry lost 25,000 jobs in 2004, declining to 5.6 million. That represented a far slower decline than in 2003, when 333,000 jobs were lost, and 2002, when employment in the technology business dropped 612,000. The severe hemorrhaging has stopped, said William T. Archey, chief executive of the trade association. Employment fell in manufacturing and communications services, which continue to shed jobs as the telecommunications industry consolidates. But jobs were added in software services and engineering and technology services. In trade, America's technology exports rose 12 percent, to $191 billion last year, while imports rose 17 percent, to $271 billion.

1172	  ONE day recently, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission decided that five nuclear power plants were potentially dangerous and ordered them shut down. Then, on the very next day, the commission reversed itself. Such is the tenuous position of the regulator.   Indeed, the job of any regulator - whether dealing with the environment, occupational safety or technologies such as nuclear reactors - is an exercise in uncertainty. Too little regulation may expose people to danger; too much may be costly and unnecessary. And even when moved to action, the regulator often cannot readily justify it. The benefit - usually a vague commodity, like 'safety' - may not be universally apparent, while the cost may be more easily measured and is often sizable.	https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/28/business/technology.html	ONE day recently, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission decided that five nuclear power plants were potentially dangerous and ordered them shut down.

The acquisition price represents an 89.2 percent premium, based on Numerical's closing price of $3.70 a share on Friday. Shares of Numerical, which is based in San Jose, Calif., closed yesterday at $6.91, up $3.21, or about 87 percent. Chip-making companies use Numerical's software and other applications to produce integrated circuits with patterns that are smaller than the wavelength of light. Numerical's applications are based on phase-shifting and optical correction technologies that compensate for distortions caused by working in such reduced dimensions. Synopsys, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., makes electronic design automation software. The company expects the deal to speed production of sub-wavelength chips as well as reduce costs and manufacturing risk for customers developing power-efficient integrated circuits. The acquisition requires regulatory approval and other closing conditions. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter.	2003-01-14T05:00:00+0000	Business/Financial Desk	Business Day	News	159

New inflation data is coming out.	https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/12/business/the-week-in-business-microsoft-ai.html	Microsoftâs often-overlooked search engine, Bing, is mounting a comeback with ChatGPT, the suddenly ubiquitous chatbot capable of composing song lyrics, writing academic essays and answering all manner of questions. The new version of Bing was released to a limited group of users on Tuesday. The revamped product is part of Microsoftâs $13 billion investment in OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab behind ChatGPT that Microsoft is betting on to stay competitive with its big tech rivals like Google, Apple and Meta. But those companies are also racing to incorporate the new technology into their own software. A day before the unveiling of the new Bing, Google announced that it would soon release an experimental chatbot called Bard for its own search engine, which is much more widely used than Bing. And Meta is fast-tracking the development of chatbot technology for its products.	2023-02-12T12:00:06+0000	SundayBusiness	Business Day	News	912

For starters, the move was smaller than the half-point increase that preceded it and much smaller than the streak of three-quarter-point jumps before that. The central bankâs decision was also accompanied by rare good news from Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, who said that âthe disinflationary process has started.â Of course, there are caveats. Mr. Powell hinted that the Fed still planned to raise rates to just above 5 percent this year and warned that âthe job is not fully doneâ in tamping down inflation. Still, investors sent stocks higher in the hope that the Fedâs rate increases were near an end.	2023-02-05T12:00:06+0000	SundayBusiness	Business Day	News	884

And the jobs report is expected to show solid gains.	https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/29/business/the-week-in-business-creeping-layoffs.html	What began as a wave of ominous job cuts by technology companies is rippling through other industries, most recently media and retail. In the last week alone, layoffs, or reports of coming layoffs, have swept The Washington Post, Vox and Saks.com. Adding to the tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers, Spotify said on Monday that it was cutting 6 percent of its work force, or about 600 employees, and IBM announced on Wednesday that it would shed 3,900. Techâs challenges may be somewhat particular to the sector â employers have largely pointed to overhiring during the pandemic as a reason for the recent cuts â but its upheaval can be an indicator of where the economy is heading. Yet even as layoffs appear to creep across the job market, unemployment claims overall remain low, and millions of jobs are open across the country.	2023-01-29T12:00:05+0000	SundayBusiness	Business Day	News	929

And the Fed meets.	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/11/business/the-week-in-business-labor-britain.html	A wave of strikes and other labor actions began in September in Britain, largely set off by workersâ frustrations that wages were not keeping up with soaring inflation. That wave is now intensifying, with hundreds walking off the job last week. About 600 workers with a nonprofit housing organization began a two-week strike, 200 employees of a brewing company went on strike and several dozen employees at a pickle factory walked out. (That could mean beer and pickle shortages over the holidays, according to the union that represents these workers.) But that may be just the beginning: Workers across industries including health care and transportation are poised to go on strike, and labor actions are planned every day through Christmas. The central issue in most cases remains pay, particularly in the public sector as the British government under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak seeks to make drastic budget cuts.

Soon, the twilight is full of drifting lights, each winking a message in peculiar semaphore: âMale seeks female for brief union.â This courtship plays out on summer nights the world over among beetles of the Lampyridae family, commonly known as fireflies.	2022-08-11T16:00:31+0000	Science	Science	News	848

2047	With a one-of-a-kind museum specimen, researchers recreated the chirp of ancient cricket relatives that droned alongside the dinosaurs.	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/science/singing-insect-wing-sound.html	Whether itâs a cicadaâs earsplitting drone, a beeâs blaring buzz or a cricketâs incessant chirp, insects are a staple of summerâs score. And arthropods have been making a racket for hundreds of millions of years. One of the noisier groups has been the Prophalangopsidae, a suite of singing insects that went mainstream during the Jurassic period when some 100 species clamored about. While related to modern crickets and katydids, these ancient arthropods left few direct descendants, making it difficult to decipher what these Mesozoic maestros sounded like.	2022-08-10T18:00:08+0000	Science	Science	News	705

Maybe youâve seen your dog or cat do it, or watched a YouTube video of a giraffe sneezing on an unsuspecting toddler at the zoo. In fact, sneezing doesnât even require a nervous system, let alone a nose, and dates back to some of the first multicellular animals: sponges.	2022-08-10T15:00:13+0000	Science	Science	News	674

2053	The twin energies of scientific curiosity and poetic invention pulsate through this study of the Romantic generationâs âsecond scientific revolution.â	https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/books/review/Benfey-t.html	In this big two-hearted river of a book, the twin energies of scientific curiosity and poetic invention pulsate on every page. Richard Holmes, the pre-eminent biographer of the Romantic generation and the author of intensely intimate lives of Shelley and Coleridge, now turns his attention to what Coleridge called the âsecond scientific revolution,â when British scientists circa 1800 made electrifying discoveries to rival those of Newton and Galileo. In Holmesâs view, âwonderâ-driven figures like the astronomer William Herschel, the chemist Humphry Davy and the explorer Joseph Banks brought âa new imaginative intensity and excitement to scientific workâ and âproduced a new vision which has rightly been called Romantic science.â 	2009-07-16T23:21:50+0000	BookReview	Books	Review	1119

2083	 DESIGN -- Choosing among hundreds of old scientific instruments, students at Middlebury College will catalog and curate a museum exhibit this month in a winter term course, 'Early Scientific Instruments: Exhibiting Artifacts From Middlebury's First Century.'    TOOLS -- Even in a world of digital readouts and nanoseconds, many of these brass, wood and glass instruments remain useful for teaching. This includes a device (pictured) that knocks a playing card out from under a ball that stays in place, demonstrating the principle of inertia. 'It's less messy than the tablecloth version of the trick,' says Fred Winkler, a physicist who is team-teaching with Ken Pohlman, a designer at the Middlebury College Museum of Art, which will display the exhibit.    EDUCATIONAL VALUE -- The course will ask: Where did these instruments come from, who built them, using what materials? What is the science that was being taught with them? Students will also learn how to 'get a simple idea across, without insulting the expert while educating the layman,' Mr. Pohlman says. And they will master 'how to write a label.'    CONTEXT -- More colleges are adding winter terms, usually with an interdisciplinary thrust to bring together students from different fields. Courses are often unconventional: DePauw University is offering 'Baseball as a Manifestation of 20th-Century History and Culture'; the University of South Alabama has 'Introduction to Wedding Photography.' Middlebury offers more than 100 winter term courses; freshmen and sophomores must take one each winter. Classes meet 12 hours a week for four weeks. They do make for a shorter vacation -- two weeks instead of the typical four to six. But Middlebury, at least, has its own ski area, the Snow Bowl.	https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/08/us/education/syllabus-science-then-and-now.html	Correction Appended	2006-01-08T05:00:00+0000	Education Life Supplement	U.S.	News	362

Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt, the kitchen is also a lab, where an understanding of a few basics at the molecular level can make a difference in your next dish.	https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/16/insider/Kenji-Lopez-Alt-science-cooking.html	J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt, a food columnist for The New York Times, approaches home cooking like a scientist. He explains the basic elements of food like proteins and fat and examines what happens to them on a molecular level during cooking â all in the name of making the best scrambled eggs, the best burger or a perfectly light schnitzel (the secret is vodka, among other things). He is also a James Beard award-winning cookbook author with a popular YouTube channel. Here, he talks about the influences that shaped his cooking, how he views science in the context of food and what he makes at home.

You can read the full text of Mr. Obama's answers here along with summaries of what Mr. McCain has said in the past on these issues.   One of the biggest differences that emerges in the Nature answers, as in previous answers to ScienceDebate08, concerns nuclear power. While Mr. McCain has previously called for building 45 new nuclear reactors by 2030, Mr. Obama sounds much more cautious:   It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option. However, before an expansion of nuclear power is considered, key issues must be addressed, including security of nuclear fuel and waste, waste storage and proliferation. The nuclear waste disposal efforts at Yucca Mountain [in Nevada] have been an expensive failure and should be abandoned. I will work with the industry and governors to develop a way to store nuclear waste safely while we pursue long-term solutions.  What does a long-term solution mean? If this means waiting until there's a form of storage that will be safe for thousands of years -- the hope for Yucca Mountain -- then when, if ever, might we expect to see new nuclear power plants? 	2008-09-25T15:13:51+0000	None	Blogs	Web Log	218

2146	The intellectual culture of scientism clouds alternative ways of knowing that can actually yield greater certainty than science.	https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/philosophy-is-not-a-science/	For roughly 98 percent of the last 2,500 years of Western intellectual history, philosophy was considered the mother of all knowledge. It generated most of the fields of research still with us today. This is why we continue to call our highest degrees Ph.D.âs, namely, philosophy doctorates. At the same time, we live an age in which many seem no longer sure what philosophy is or is good for anymore. Most seem to see it as a highly abstracted discipline with little if any bearing on objective reality â something more akin to art, literature or religion. All have plenty to say about reality. But the overarching assumption is that none of it actually qualifies as knowledge until proven scientifically.	2012-04-06T00:30:23+0000	\N	Opinion	News	1719

Last week, John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, voiced fears that Dr. Healy was attempting to dismantle O.S.I., which looks into charges of incompetence and fakery by research scientists. He said at a hearing that Dr. Healy had derailed two critical investigations, demoralized and emasculated the O.S.I. and made a mockery of the O.S.I.'s independence.

2185	Novels, graphic and otherwise, about the world at war, life with no future and imagined universes.	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/books/review/provenance-ann-leckie-best-fantasy-science-fiction.html	Ann Leckieâs latest space romp, PROVENANCE (Orbit, $26), isnât really a space opera in the same way as the award-winning Imperial Radch trilogy that made her famous. It might be tempting, therefore, to insist that comparisons are unfair. Yet theyâre also unavoidable â largely because, even though âProvenanceâ centers on non-Radchaai societies, it is effectively a sequel. Now that a treaty has been established between the empire and the enigmatic, violent, technologically superior Presger, countless planets breathe easier. But the peace will last only so long as the âcivilizedâ races of the universe actually act civilized.	2017-09-06T09:00:11+0000	BookReview	Books	Review	1302

2212	Why are we spending precious hours in school teaching our children to be garbage collectors?	https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/blogs/10tierneylab-science-461.html	If we want our children to be scientifically literate and get good jobs in the future, why are we spending precious hours in school teaching them to be garbage collectors?  That's the question that occurred to me after reading about the second-graders in West Virginia who fought for the right to keep recycling trash even after it became so uneconomical that public officials tried to stop the program. As my colleague Kate Galbraith reports, their teacher was proud of them for all the time they spent campaigning to keep the recycling program alive.   My colleague Andy Revkin suggests that the West Virginia students might be learning something useful about the interplay of economics and ecology, but I fear they and their teacher have missed the lesson. The reason that public officials cut back the program, as Matt Richtel and Kate reported, is the market for recyclables has collapsed because the supply vastly exceeds the demand. This could be a valuable learning experience for the students about markets and about the long-term tendency of prices of natural resources to fall while the cost of people's time rises.   Instead, the students are being taught that saving resources is more important than saving human time, and that recycling is such a righteous activity that it deserves to continue even when it costs money and time to do it. That may be a popular belief, but that's all it is, a belief.  I've always thought of recycling as essentially a religious sacrament --a fine activity if pursued voluntarily, but not something that should be mandated or taught in public schools.   I once watched a third-grade science class spend the whole period collecting and analyzing garbage. Couldn't those students have been learning something more profound in science class? Couldn't the students in West Virginia have been doing something more useful with their time? 	2008-12-11T00:11:55+0000	None	Blogs	Web Log	308

2228	In this homage to 10 curious souls, George Johnson singles out efforts eloquent and profound.	https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/books/review/Dizikes-t.html	Beauty is truth, Keats declared, and truth beauty. Many prominent scientists have wished a version of this famous equation described their own work. The British quantum theorist Paul Dirac, for one, called his career âa search for pretty mathematics.â Most scientific aesthetes gaze fondly upon equations or arrangements of facts. A few, like the science writer George Johnson, also see beauty in the act of research. Johnsonâs new book, âThe Ten Most Beautiful Experiments,â is an appealing account of important scientific discoveries to which a variation of Keats applies: occasionally, beauty yields truth.	2008-04-13T04:00:00+0000	BookReview	Books	Review	868
2229	Why start worrying now about scientists pushing a political agenda?	https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/blogs/27tierneylab-politici523.html	Why start worrying now about scientists pushing a political agenda? That question was raised by many critics of my Findings column and blog post about Roger Pielke Jr.'s book on the roles of scientists in making policy, The Honest Broker. Wasn't it disingenuous, the critics asked, to worry about the politicization of science now instead of during the Bush administration?   I agree that there were lots of attempts to use science for political ends during the Bush years. I wrote about some of the questionable claims by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the White House drug czar's office. In his book, Dr. Pielke devotes a chapter to the Bush's administration manipulation of expert conclusions on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The politicization of science is clearly a bipartisan affair, and I don't think Republicans are any less prone to this problem than Democrats.  But I do think that this problem may be more difficult to spot when the Democrats are in power, simply because so many scientists are personally sympathetic to Democratic policies. Surveys and exit polls have found a preponderance of Democrats among academics and Ph.D.s. However much they try to be impartial, they're prone to the confirmation bias, which makes them less skeptical of results and statements that jibe with their own beliefs.   Some readers also complained that I was unfair in my column in questioning warnings made by Steven Chu, the new secretary of energy, and John Holdren, the nominee for presidential science adviser. Stewart commented:    . . . you do not indicate whether either Dr. Chu or Dr. Holdren misrepresent the current state of knowledge or concern among scientists in the areas they are speaking about. If what they say is uncomfortable, but represents the consensus, then we have good reason to be discomforted and act. If they offend some political scientists (not scientists, but laymen in science, who clearly have agendas), then tough. What are the current predictions for California's water supply over the next 100 years (in a word, dire). What is the carrying capacity of the Earth, in the best judgement of the most qualified group?   Let's look at the warning I cited from Dr. Chu, which came an interview with Jim Tankersley (whose article about it ran in the the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers). He discusses a future climate scenario in which, due to a failure to restrict carbon emissions, the snow pack in the California mountains declines by 70 to 90 percent by the end of the century. When asked if this means California would be looking at a scenario of permanent water rationing, Dr. Chu replies:   No, you're looking at a scenario where there's no more agriculture in California. When you lose 70 percent of your water in the mountains, I don't see how agriculture can continue. California produces 20 percent of the agriculture in the United States. I don't actually see how they can keep their cities going.   This strikes me as problematic for several reasons. First, it's based on computer models of regional climate change, which are far less reliable than models of global change. But even if you accept the model, even if you assume the snow pack essentially disappears, it doesn't follow that California's agriculture and cities would also disappear -- and Dr. Chu's scientific training in atomic physics doesn't give him any special foresight on this question. He is not an expert in agriculture or water-supply management or urban economics.   Before Californians abandoned all their farms and homes, they'd certainly consider alternate sources of water -- like, say, the Pacific Ocean. The use of desalinated water has grown rapidly in America in recent years and is projected to become increasingly cost-effective, according to recent reports from the National Research Council and a state task force in California. If technology keeps improving and people getting richer, it could become more and more affordable.  Now, I have no idea how cheap or plentiful desalinated water will be in California at the end of this century -- for all I know, Californians will still be drinking runoff from the snow in the mountains, or they'll have found other ways to conserve or import enough water for their needs. Nor do I minimize the possibility that climate change could affect the current water supply system. My point is simply that there are plenty of ways for Californians to prevent their state from becoming an empty desert, and that I'm skeptical of an expert's warning that the state will become a wasteland in 2090 unless we all quickly adopt his carbon-cutting strategies. It reminds me of the past mistaken prophecies of doom from the Club of Rome and other supposed experts who failed to anticipate the adaptability of humans.   In Dr. Holdren's confirmation hearing in the Senate, he was asked by Senator David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, about some of the massive famines and other disasters he had envisioned, like his 1971 warning (issued together with the ecologist Paul Ehrlich) that some form of eco-catastrophe, if not thermonuclear war, seems almost certain to overtake us before the end of the century. Was that a responsible prediction, Mr. Vitter asked?  Dr. Holdren replied that one of the things I've learned in the intervening nearly four decades is that predictions about the future are difficult.   He defended his past warnings by saying, I would argue that the motivation for looking at the downside possibilities, the possibilities that can go wrong, is to motivate people to change directions.  What do you think of that argument?   (Dr. Pielke Jr. has some thoughts at the Prometheus blog on doomsaying scientists and other questions raised by my column about his book.) 	2009-02-27T20:23:39+0000	None	Blogs	Web Log	948

2252	When Donald Kennedy, a biologist and editor of the eminent journal Science, was asked what had led so many American scientists to feel that George W. Bush's administration is anti-science, he isolated a familiar pair of culprits: climate change and stem cells. These represent, he said, 'two solid issues in which there is a real difference between a strong consensus in the science community and the response of the administration to that consensus.' Both issues have in fact riled scientists since the early days of the administration, and both continue to have broad repercussions. In March 2001, the White House abruptly withdrew its support for the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, and the U.S. withdrawal was still a locus of debate at this summer's G8 summit in Scotland. And the administration's decision to limit federal funds for embryonic-stem-cell research four years ago -- a move that many scientists worry has severely hampered one of the most fruitful avenues of biomedical inquiry to come along in decades -- resulted in a shift in the dynamics of financing, from the federal government to the states and private institutions. In November 2004, Californians voted to allocate $3 billion for stem-cell research in what was widely characterized as a 'scientific secession.'     Yet what remains most divisive, according to Kennedy, is not the Bush administration's specific policies, but a more general sense that 'scientific conclusions, reached either within agencies or by people outside of government, are being changed for political reasons by people who have not done the scientific work.' It is this sense that science is being 'misused' that has given rise to two Congressional bills.  	https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/magazine/political-science.html	When Donald Kennedy, a biologist and editor of the eminent journal Science, was asked what had led so many American scientists to feel that George W.

But when one like the New York Botanical Garden reinvents itself, the effect is very different.	2006-05-15T05:00:00+0000	Editorial Desk	Opinion	Editorial	360

Lee submerges readers without explanation into the hexarchate â a star-spanning far-future society whose culture relies on advanced mathematics to produce âexotic effectsâ that are nigh magical. A sort of unearthly physics, these can make select individuals functionally immortal, even as exotic generators churn forth monstrous Â­vector-scrambling storms that disintegrate enemy soldiers down to component atoms. At the core of the technology is the high calendar. More than just a measurement of time, this calendar shapes the mathematical base of the exotic effects. Yet by changing the calendar and thus the underlying math of reality, dissidents can cripple hexarchate technology â a heresy to those in control, who punish dissenters by destroying them whole planets at a time. The disproportionate reprisals inevitably beget more heresy, so the hexarchate exists in a perpetual state of war in which it is too beneficially invested ever to end.	2016-08-11T09:30:03+0000	BookReview	Books	Review	1295

Soap operas are television (originally radio) dramas that play like bad librettos without music. Space operas are science fiction stories that use the entire universe (and sometimes several universes) as backdrop for over-the-top plots -- often without any recognizably human emotions in view. It has been Catherine Asaro's genius to combine space and soap opera to produce a heavy-breathing series called the Saga of the Skolian Empire. This series has attracted many fans, both of science fiction and of the genre known as romance fiction. The sixth Skolian novel, 'The Quantum Rose,' was recognized in 2001 with a Nebula Award for best novel, a prize granted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.	2003-10-12T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1120

2298	Denise Grady answered select reader questions on her article about a new laser technique for treating brain aneurysms from this week's Science Times.    Q. How was the bleeding kept under control after the laser made the cut in the artery? Why did Dr. Langer not use an artery from the chest [as is done in heart by pass surgery] for the bypass? A vein is more likely to get clogged up after a few years. - I. Jochelman    A. An open end of a segment of vein was sewn to the wall of the brain artery, making a sort of a T junction. Then, the laser was slipped into the vein and put flush up against the artery wall to make the hole. Then, as you suspect, the artery does bleed through the hole. But the laser is taken out quickly, and the vein is clamped. This does not affect blood flow in the artery. Later, after the vein is joined to the vein that has been sewn into the neck, completing the bypass, the clamp is removed.    Q. Before you revealed Dr. Tulleken's technique, I was thinking, why don't they just do the graft first? I just assumed it would be much like performing a heart bypass. So the question is---why hasn't neurosurgery always used a non-tie-off approach to manage aneurysm? Also, I don't quite understand the significance of the laser. Does it create a connection site for the graft that is not otherwise possible? Finally, does the procedure have a name? Thanks very much. -- J. Westropp    A. As the article mentions, if you cut the hole in the artery first, there will be too much bleeding. You have to clamp. If you sew on the vein graft first, how do you get to the artery to cut the hole? This is what the laser does: as the story says, they can slip into the vein to make the hole.  	https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/22/health/science/ask-science.html	Denise Grady answered select reader questions on her article about a new laser technique for treating brain aneurysms from this week's Science Times.	2006-12-22T05:00:00+0000	Science Desk	Health	Question	762

The name is a sly reference to the New Wave of the 1960's, when English and American writers as varied as Michael Moorcock, J. G. Ballard, Harlan Ellison and Samuel R. Delany cast a suspicious eye on genre staples like space travel and future technology. The Next Wave -- which, depending on who's counting, includes British novelists like M. John Harrison, Richard K.

2306	A detailed new book by the molecular biologist Karyn Lynn Newman offers lively insight.	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/dining/sourdough-by-science-karyn-lynn-newman.html	Two years into the pandemic, and perhaps you still havenât tackled sourdough? This highly detailed new book, âSourdough by Science,â written with lively insight by Karyn Lynn Newman, a molecular biologist, might get you into fermentation after all. Dr. Newman clearly explains what goes on with sourdough starter. Though she gives instructions for developing your own, she recommends buying it for reliability. Different flours, salt, proportions and equipment, as well as the steps that ensure successful dough-making, are covered. And there are recipes, including options you might not associate with sourdough, like focaccia. What if your crust is not shiny? Is the flavor too sour? She troubleshoots as well. 	2022-04-04T16:21:07+0000	Dining	Food	News	152

2311	Bringing back the woolly mammoth is an intriguing notion, but perhaps not highest on our list of priorities.	https://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/blogs/25judson-resurrec103.html	(Photo: An intact skeleton of a woolly mammoth on display at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. (S. C. Schuster))   Last week, the woolly mammoth came back.   Into the news, that is. For it has had its genome sequenced, and is the first extinct animal to have done so.  The sequence is a draft â for technical reasons, parts of it are likely to be inaccurate â and it is not yet complete. But that didn't stop joyous speculations about the prospects for the mammoth's resurrection.   (Photo: Fossil specimen of a glyptodon in Vienna at the Naturhistorisches Museum. (Wikimedia Commons)) And I have to say, I love this stuff. I adore thinking about the science that would need to be done to bring back an extinct species, be it a mammoth or a glyptodon, a dodo or a Neanderthal. (Glyptodons were boulder-sized mammals related to armadillos, and are a particular favorite of mine. They used to live in South America, and they went extinct at about the same time as the mammoths, around 10,000 years ago.)   The outline of how to stage a resurrection is clear. In essence, it's a matter of cross-species cloning â using an egg from one species to host the genome of the other. The procedure is more or less the same as for regular cloning. First, you make a blank egg by removing the egg's nucleus â this contains the egg's genome. You then insert the genome of the animal you want to clone.   In regular cloning, the genome is from the same species as the egg. In cross-species cloning, the genome and egg are from different species. So, for mammoths, you'd put mammoth DNA into a blank elephant egg, and transplant the egg into an elephant surrogate mother. For Neanderthals, you'd put Neanderthal DNA into a blank human egg, and have a human surrogate mother (or, one day, perhaps, an artificial womb). For a bird like a dodo, you'd put dodo DNA into a blank pigeon egg (dodos were essentially big flightless pigeons), and pop the egg into an incubator. Easy peasy.  Or not. In the decade since Dolly the Sheep was cloned, enormous progress has been made on regular cloning. To date, more than 10 different species of mammal have been cloned, including ferrets, rabbits, horses, cows and pigs. Nonetheless, success rates are still extremely low. Even for cows, the animals that have been cloned the most, fewer than 5 percent of embryos transferred to surrogate mothers result in offspring. A recent report on dog clones illustrates the problem: of 358 embryos transplanted into 20 females, two pregnancies became established, and only one puppy was born.   The reasons for the failures are many and various. Sometimes the embryos don't grow. Sometimes the placenta goes wrong. Many clones are stillborn, or born with gross abnormalities. In short, despite the successes, cloning is still far from being reliable or routine.   Given the difficulties of normal cloning, it's surprising that cross-species cloning has been tried, let alone had any successes. But it has. For example, two African wildcat kitten clones have been born from domestic cats, and three gray wolf clones have been born from domestic dogs. Again, though, the failure rates have been high. To get the three wolves, 372 embryos were transferred into surrogate mothers. The wildcats were even worse: 1,552 embryos were transferred, but only two healthy kittens were born (in all, 17 were born, but 7 were born dead and 8 died shortly after birth).  Cloning a mammoth would be even more difficult. For one thing, elephants and mammoths are less closely related to each other than cats and wildcats or dogs and wolves, so the difficulties would likely be greater in any case. And elephants have a 22-month pregnancy â so you'd have to wait a long time to find out whether the experiment had worked.  But there's a far more profound problem, as well. The normal way to get a new genome into a blank egg is to take a single cell from the animal you want to clone, and fuse it with the egg. The nucleus of that single cell then becomes the nucleus of the egg. But with a mammoth, this almost certainly won't work. Because mammoth carcasses have been lying around for 10,000 years or more, their cells aren't in good shape and their genomes are shattered. Instead of being neatly arranged in chromosomes, as ours are, mammoth genomes are in tiny pieces. So before we could put a mammoth genome into an egg, we would have to build one â something we are nowhere close to being able to do. Woolly mammoths will not be coming soon to a zoo near you.  All the same, research in this direction would surely yield astonishing discoveries. Our efforts to clone have opened up immense vistas of new research questions, and advances in the field have already shed light on fundamental aspects of how an embryo grows. During growth, cells become committed to being one type of tissue or another â heart muscle, say, or skin cells. Through cloning, we are learning how to reverse those commitments, something that may, one day, lead to revolutionary medical treatments. Likewise, learning to build a genome, whether of a mammoth or anything else, will certainly be interesting, and will probably be important in ways that we can't foresee.  And yet. No matter how much I enjoy thinking about the science of resurrection â and I do â I have to admit that the absence of mammoths isn't exactly a pressing problem. What is pressing is the number of species we are currently in danger of losing. It would be a shame if, in 200 years, our descendants were wondering whether to try and resurrect the elephant or the polar bear, the albatross or the mourning dove.   Let's get our act together. Let's prevent that first.  **********  NOTES:  For the genome of the woolly mammoth, see Miller, W. et al. 2008. Sequencing the nuclear genome of the extinct woolly mammoth. Nature 456: 387-390.

For the latest Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, you turned to monthly magazines like Astounding Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. There you found short stories of varying lengths along with 'serials,' novel-length narratives broken into two, three or more installments. Each installment began with a brief synopsis so densely packed with information as to be virtually unintelligible. If for some reason you missed the beginning of a serial, you had to piece together what was happening from clues embedded in the latest installment. Even many of the ostensibly stand-alone short stories belonged to loosely connected series, set in societies, worlds or universes that the writer had used before. (Anyone who has tried to create a fictional but plausible world from scratch will appreciate the economies involved.) Since these stories typically assumed familiarity with the series background, you learned to be alert for details that related the action at hand to a grander context.	2002-10-13T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1125

Delany has negotiated the passage from boy wonder to grand old man of science fiction with enviable grace. Delany, who published eight well-received novels before his 25th birthday and has won four Nebula Awards and two Hugos, is now a professor of English and creative writing at Temple University. Over the last two decades he has become science fiction's leading academic critic, bringing to bear on the finest products of the genre the apparatus of postmodern analysis.	2003-04-27T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1096

The novel's characters, who spoke a mellifluous Caribbean patois, did not have to travel to other worlds to confront strange life-forms; the spirits of West African religious tradition were all around them in a decaying near-future Toronto, intervening in their everyday lives for good or ill. Without offering any scientific explanation for the witchcraft she evoked, Hopkinson treated the spirit world with the same rigor and respect other writers bring to rocket science or molecular biology.	2000-04-30T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1094

2340	Intense and crucial role of computers in all areas of scientific research discussed; Thomas B Kepler of Santa Fe Institute notes that physics is almost entirely computational now, but says biggest change is among biologists who just ten years ago were 'very dismissive' of need for computation; photos; researchers who have long distinguished between experiments done in vivo, with living creature, or in vitro, inside test tube, now commonly refer to work done in silica (M)	https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/weekinreview/the-world-in-silica-fertilization-all-science-is-computer-science.html	EXCEPT for the fact that everything, including DNA and proteins, is made from quarks, particle physics and biology don't seem to have a lot in common. One science uses mammoth particle accelerators to explore the subatomic world; the other uses petri dishes, centrifuges and other laboratory paraphernalia to study the chemistry of life. But there is one tool both have come to find indispensable: supercomputers powerful enough to sift through piles of data that would crush the unaided mind.	2001-03-25T05:00:00+0000	Week in Review Desk	Week in Review	News	1063

Abbott wrote a short book called 'Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions.' Although Abbott's academic specialty was classics, not mathematics, he set out to describe what life might be like for creatures who lived in a two-dimensional world. The result is a charming brainteaser that challenges inhabitants of what Abbott called Spaceland -- that is, our three-dimensional world -- to imagine an existence strictly delimited by plane geometry. 'Flatland,' which is still in print, purports to be the memoirs of A. Square, who has the dubious fortune to spend 24 hours in Spaceland yet cannot convince his 2-D compatriots that reality extends beyond their familiar plane of existence.	2002-06-16T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1097

Baxter's goal is nothing less than to dramatize the grand sweep of primate development, beginning with a rodentlike Eve scrabbling for survival in the dinosaur-dominated forests of North America 65 million years ago and extending to an imaginary whimper some 500 million years in the future.	2003-03-02T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1099
2349	Gerald Jonas reviews following books: Coyote by Allen M Steele; The Poison Master by Liz Williams; Jubilee by Jack Dann; and Worlds Enough & Time by Dan Simmons (M)	https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/05/books/science-fiction.html	COYOTE (Ace, $23.95), by Allen M. Steele, is full of pleasant surprises. It is actually three books in one, each a bracing turn on a genre staple. The first story is a near-future political thriller in which a right-wing coup has resulted in the overthrow of the constitutional government of the United States, erecting a fascist state called the United Republic of America. To awe its enemies, the republic decides to colonize a recently discovered Earth-type planet called Coyote. But a group of rebels, led by conspirators within the government's space program, plans to hijack the transport spaceship and replace the government's hand-picked colonists with 100 leading dissidents and their families. Steele manages to wring considerable suspense from this scenario, which reads like an updated version of Sinclair Lewis's antifascist novel of 1935, 'It Can't Happen Here.'	2003-01-05T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1134

Neal Asher's grimly assured novel THE SKINNER (Tor/Tom Doherty, $26.95) projects the terror-haunted sensibility of our time into a future of limitless brutality. Like his fellow Brit Richard K. Morgan in his Takeshi Kovacs novels, Asher assumes that science's success in extending life will only multiply the opportunities for inflicting pain.	2004-04-18T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1149

Or is she? Karen is the protagonist of Bonanno's new novel PRETERNATURAL3 (Tor/Tom Doherty, $24.95), which is the third volume of a series that began in 1997. The uncertain nature of the relationship between creator and creation is very much the point of this stylish, difficult and surprisingly moving work of metafiction.	2002-11-10T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1116

It was a scientifically heralded result, but behind the hoopla was just one small catch.

2364	Gerald Jonas reviews following books: Wild Seed by Octavia E Butler; Domain by Steve Alten; and Ventus by Karl Schroeder (M)	https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/books/science-fiction.html	Science fiction is a genre without clear boundaries. It is not fiction about science but fiction that bids for the reader's attention by clothing its fabrications with the authority of science. Stories that explore the social impact of scientific advances are obviously science fiction. But so are stories that adopt the measured, dispassionate tone of scientific communication -- what Isaac Asimov called a 'transparent' style -- to lend plausibility to the most outlandish flights of imagination. Octavia E. Butler, the only science fiction writer to win a MacArthur Foundation 'genius' grant, has been extending the genre's reach in unexpected directions during a career that spans three decades.	2001-04-29T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1057

Instead of the future, these stories speculate about the past. How different would the world be if the South had won the Civil War? If Germany and Japan had won World War II? Playing out such counterfactual premises offers unique rewards. One is the almost guilty pleasure of imagining yourself into a radically altered here-and-now -- like the Japanese-dominated North America of Philip K. Dick's 'Man in the High Castle' -- where your world is viewed as imaginary. Another is to watch Kim Stanley Robinson breathe life into an extended meditation on the historical process, as he so deftly does in THE YEARS OF RICE AND SALT (Bantam, $25.95).	2002-04-28T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1135

These canned bits of 'future history' are usually a sign of authorial laziness; it is more difficult but far more effective to embed the necessary information in the fabric of the story, so that readers experience everything from the point of view of the major characters.	2003-11-09T05:00:00+0000	Book Review Desk	Books	Review	1115

His best novels, like 'The Divide' and 'The Harvest,' reimagine such standard themes as poor-lonely-superman and aliens-bearing-gifts in narratives that are both literate and suspenseful.

2927	âWhen McKinsey Comes to Town,â by the Times reporters Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe, argues that the legendary firm has accrued an inordinate amount of influence chasing profits at the expense of moral principle.	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/books/review/when-mckinsey-comes-to-town-walt-bogdanich-michael-forsythe.html	In 2002, Martin Elling, along with three colleagues at the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, published an article in the firmâs quarterly journal intended to gin up more business from the pharmaceutical industry. Ellingâs article argued that drug companies were missing an opportunity by not tracking how often individual physicians were prescribing certain drugs. By aggregating such data, pharmaceutical salespeople could target their marketing pitches to the doctors most likely to become heavy prescribers, and the sales reps themselves could also be better evaluated by their companies. Soon enough, a relatively unknown drug company called Purdue Pharma came calling, retaining McKinsey in 2004 to help increase sales of its opioid pain killer OxyContin â which had already topped $1 billion annually. In the face of a worsening national opioid addiction crisis and multiple state and federal investigations, prescriptions of higher-strength OxyContin pills had begun to level off. Among other recommendations, McKinsey, led by Elling and his team, suggested âturbochargingâ sales through more innovative and aggressive marketing tactics. Between 2004 and 2019, Purdue paid McKinsey $83.7 million in fees.	2022-09-29T13:00:07+0000	BookReview	Books	Review	1315

Many were following the Fed, which increased its prime lending rate to a target range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent from roughly zero a year ago. The effect: stocks and bonds slumped on concerns that the increases would slow the economy.	2022-12-28T12:52:01+0000	Business	Business Day	News	996

2981	The national average gasoline price has fallen to where it was a year ago. Chinaâs economy is not expected to bounce back quickly, as it rolls back âzero Covidâ policies. And the Fed meets.	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/11/business/the-week-in-business-labor-britain.html	A wave of strikes and other labor actions began in September in Britain, largely set off by workersâ frustrations that wages were not keeping up with soaring inflation. That wave is now intensifying, with hundreds walking off the job last week. About 600 workers with a nonprofit housing organization began a two-week strike, 200 employees of a brewing company went on strike and several dozen employees at a pickle factory walked out. (That could mean beer and pickle shortages over the holidays, according to the union that represents these workers.) But that may be just the beginning: Workers across industries including health care and transportation are poised to go on strike, and labor actions are planned every day through Christmas. The central issue in most cases remains pay, particularly in the public sector as the British government under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak seeks to make drastic budget cuts. Mr. Sunak has said he is working on âtough new lawsâ against these strikes.	2022-12-11T12:00:09+0000	SundayBusiness	Business Day	News	887

[C3.]    Video Game Industry Loses Some Sales Power  In an industry that has a reputation for growth, a fall-off in video game sales is clashing with expectations. [C1.]    A Spotlight on Super Bowl Commercials  The fact that Super Bowl ads are now made widely available outside the broadcast of the game -- on Web sites, for downloading and as video-on-demand programs -- seemed to inspire advertisers and agencies to broaden their appeal beyond the typical male football fanatic. To be sure, some spots were aimed at the lowest common denominator, but refreshingly, they were outnumbered by spots reaching for a higher form of hilarity or trying to tug at the heartstrings. A commercial for Burger King, above, made fun of musical production numbers. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C5.]    Companies Await Ruling on Biotech Food  The battle over agricultural biotechnology could reach a tipping point this week, when the World Trade Organization is expected to render its verdict on charges by the United States that Europe is illegally restricting imports of genetically modified crops.

[Page C1.]    How a New Employee Uncovered an Unusual Refco Loan  Peter F. James had been working at Refco for less than two months when he noticed something this summer that teams of accountants had apparently missed for years. Mr. James, recently hired in the controller's office, wondered why a larger-than-normal interest payment had been made to Refco on an outstanding loan made by the company. In August he started to ask questions, eventually taking his concerns to the chief financial officer. The answers would eventually lead to the departure of the chief executive and the rapid unraveling of the firm, prompting its filing for bankruptcy protection last week.

[C1.]    Used and Useless Computers Litter Developing Countries  Much of the used computer equipment sent from the United States to developing countries for use in homes, schools and businesses is often neither usable nor reparable, creating enormous environmental problems in some of the world's poorest places, according to a report to be issued today by an environmental organization. The report says that the unusable equipment is being donated or sold to developing nations by recycling businesses in the United States as a way to dodge the expense of having to recycle it properly. The report, prepared by the Basel Action Network of Seattle, focuses on Nigeria, in western Africa, but says the situation is similar throughout much of the developing world.

[C5.]    Consumer Blogs Get Attention From Product Makers  As the number of blogs has grown, more consumers are keeping Web diaries dedicated exclusively to their favorite brands. Most of these, like one maintained by Darren Rovell, left, who compiles articles and commentary on Gatorade, are done without the consent of the companies that own the brands, but some companies are starting to pay attention, using the blogs as a kind of informal network of consumer opinion. [C6.]    Criticism of Yahoo Disclosure in China Rises  Yahoo has suffered a good deal of opprobrium since it was revealed last month that, when government officials came calling, the company's Hong Kong division simply surrendered information on a Chinese citizen who had presumably sought anonymity in a Yahoo e-mail address.

The new model will come in both passenger and freighter versions, ending widespread speculation that Boeing would offer only a freighter version and concede the market for superlarge passenger jets to Airbus. The A380, however, would remain the largest commercial airliner, with 555 seats, compared with the 747-8's 446 seats. [C2.]    Fed Nominee Defends Inflation Target Strategy  Ben S.

And one of the biggest crypto exchanges collapsed. 	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/business/the-week-in-business-layoffs-meta.html	What began as a pause in hiring at Meta escalated into mass layoffs last week, with the companyâs founder, Mark Zuckerberg, culling more than 11,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of the work force. He said the company, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, had grown too quickly during the pandemic, when a boom in online commerce lifted many tech companies. The layoffs were the latest in a string of cuts and hiring freezes across the industry. In the last few weeks alone, Twitter, Stripe and Lyft together have cut thousands of workers, and Amazon said it was pausing hiring for its corporate work force. The layoffs may tell a larger story about the outlook for the economy. But in some cases, unique factors contributed to the cuts: Twitterâs upheaval, for example, largely owes to Elon Muskâs takeover, while at Meta, billions have been invested in Mr. Zuckerbergâs vision for the metaverse, at a time when the company is already struggling financially.	2022-11-13T12:00:05+0000	SundayBusiness	Business Day	News	923

The representative did not seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation, and told me she needed to email the hotel and give them 30 minutes to respond before she could help. Over an hour later, the representative, who told me no supervisors were available, said I would receive an email with new lodging arrangements. I never did (and the hotels I tried were all booked because of the U.S. Open tennis tournament).

And one of the biggest crypto exchanges collapsed. 	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/business/the-week-in-business-layoffs-meta.html	What began as a pause in hiring at Meta escalated into mass layoffs last week, with the companyâs founder, Mark Zuckerberg, culling more than 11,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of the work force. He said the company, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, had grown too quickly during the pandemic, when a boom in online commerce lifted many tech companies. The layoffs were the latest in a string of cuts and hiring freezes across the industry. In the last few weeks alone, Twitter, Stripe and Lyft together have cut thousands of workers, and Amazon said it was pausing hiring for its corporate work force. The layoffs may tell a larger story about the outlook for the economy. But in some cases, unique factors contributed to the cuts: Twitterâs upheaval, for example, largely owes to Elon Muskâs takeover, while at Meta, billions have been invested in Mr. Zuckerbergâs vision for the metaverse, at a time when the company is already struggling financially.	2022-11-13T12:00:05+0000	SundayBusiness	Business Day	News	923

3561	Higher-than-expected inflation in August rattled financial markets. The Federal Reserve is expected to approve another big rate increase. But Social Security recipients have a reason to cheer.	https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/business/the-week-in-business-rail-strike.html	With less than 24 hours until a critical deadline for negotiations, the countryâs largest rail companies reached a tentative agreement with labor unions representing some 115,000 workers early Thursday morning. An impasse in bargaining brought workers to the brink of a strike that could have started as soon as Friday, with far-reaching consequences for the already mangled supply chain as well as inflation and Amtrak service. The main sticking points had to do with scheduling and sick time: Labor groups were asking that workers be allowed to see a doctor or attend to a personal matter without risking disciplinary action. White House officials got involved in trying to bring the two sides to a deal both because of the economic impact of a work stoppage and the political impact on President Biden and his party before the midterm elections. Martin J. Walsh, the Labor secretary, helped broker the tentative agreement, which gives workers one additional paid day off and the ability to go to medical appointments without penalty, labor unions said. It still needs to be ratified by union members â a process that could take weeks â but workers have agreed not to strike while the votes are tallied.	2022-09-18T11:00:06+0000	SundayBusiness	Business Day	News	925

On the other hand, I donât have anything against her, and law school is universally scary during the first year. Should I be thinking about this differently? Is it wrong to bow out?

I was lying on my side on a plastic-covered couch, my neck craned over its arm, my mother beside me consulting with a doctor, and I was speaking in tongues. Some spirit was moving through me, causing me to regurgitate all that I had seen in the years leading to this moment. This spirit was not the Lord or any other celestial being. I knew exactly what I was referring to with each word and could envision the source material as my lips pinballed through my memory. It was, to my surprise and dismay, months and months of quotes and quips I had read since the inception of the Facebook News Feed, now bubbling up from my subconscious in an inscrutable cacophony of youthspeak.	2022-10-11T09:00:17+0000	OpEd	Opinion	Op-Ed	1551

If you followed this debate closely â excruciatingly closely, in the cases of the mysteriously sick and their loved ones â you noticed it breaking into the mainstream occasionally: a magazine feature here, a celebrity memoir there.

If the contracts were terminated, those people who are part of Aetna's H.M.O. would not have been covered for care at the hospitals. The hospitals had said that Aetna's reimbursement rates were not enough to cover costs and that reimbursement was being denied in four times as many cases as other insurance companies.

I have never smoked, but I thought it might someday be a curious cultural anthropological artifact for my grandchildren. With the radical smoking bans taking effect in New York State and New York City, this creation from another era is becoming extinct sooner than I could ever imagine.

4558	  EMPLOYERS, insurers, medical societies and hospitals are pressing to create tests and guidelines that they hope will bring more order and economic accountability to a health-care system that has traditionally been based on the judgments of doctors who may often disagree.   In a major development last week, 11 large companies and their insurers decided to test a system in which employees and their doctors are asked about specific results of medical treatments.    Employees treated for lower back pain, for example, would be asked whether they could climb stairs, bend over to tie their shoes and do other things reflecting their health status.    The test will seek to determine whether the system is a useful and valid way of demonstrating accountability, said Bill Goss, the health-care programs manager at the General Electric Company. Large employers spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on employee health care. But we are not really sure whether we are getting value from it, said Mr. Goss, who is chairman of the group conducting the test.    The companies and insurers taking part include American Telephone and Telegraph, with the Travelers; Ameritech, with Illinois Blue Cross and Blue Shield; Digital Equipment, with Fallon Community Health Plan, Harvard Community Health Plan and Matthew Thornton Health Plan, three New England health maintenance organizations; General Electric's aerospace unit, with U.S. Healthcare, and General Motors, with Blue Cross of Missouri and St. Louis and Kaiser Permanente in Cleveland.   Other participants are Hercules, with the Intermountain group in Salt Lake City; Honeywell, with  Doctors and patients will use questionnaires developed by medical authorities for Dr. Paul Ellwood, president of Interstudy, a nonprofit research group based in Excelsior, Minn. The sponsor is the American Managed Care Association, whose members include 150 large companies that use health maintenance organizations and networks of doctors and hospitals.    During 12 months, the 11 companies will all ask employees about the same two or three medical conditions. Lower back pain, angina (heart attack) and asthma are the most likely subjects, said John Doyle, the project's coordinator at Interstudy.    Dr. Ellwood said Interstudy questionnaires were already being used in a similar project at half a dozen group medical practices across the country, including the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. The American Group Practices Association is the sponsor.    In yet another project, General Motors, Ford Motor, Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers union agreed this month to work on quality-ofcare measures with nine health maintenance organizations in southeastern Michigan. The H.M.O.'s will be required to meet certain standards and their members will be asked whether the H.M.O.'s provided satisfactory care.    The American Medical Association and several medical specialty professional groups are taking a different tack. They are developing guidelines for medical procedures and treatments that are based on a consensus of views of experienced doctors and from medical journals.    The A.M.A. says the guidelines will be parameters, leaving ample room for variations in particular cases. The specialty societies' fear is that if they don't develop guidelines, the Government will do it for them, said Dr. David M. Eddy, a professor of health policy and management at Duke University.    Indeed, Congress has already ordered Federal studies of both guidelines and medical results that the Government calls patient outcome research. At least we ought to know where we are getting the biggest bang for the buck without causing harm to patients, said Ira Raskin, an economist who is acting director of the Center for Medical Effectiveness at the Federal Public Health Service.    Hospitals are also developing practice guidelines and statements of expected performance, said Dennis O'Leary, president of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, which accredits hospitals.    We used to assume that clinical judgment alone was an adequate source of truth, Dr. Eddy said. Now we have to go out there and measure the consequences of different medical activities.    The problem is: How do you measure the whole spectrum of health care? said Margaret E. O'Kane, executive director of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a nonprofit group that accredits health maintenance organizations. There are whole areas where you just don't know the answers. We're all grappling for measurements.	https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/19/business/business-and-health-accountability-in-health-care.html	EMPLOYERS, insurers, medical societies and hospitals are pressing to create tests and guidelines that they hope will bring more order and economic accountability to a health-care system that has traditionally been based on the judgments of doctors who may often disagree.	1991-02-19T05:00:00+0000	Financial Desk	Business Day	News	683

4574	The Senate health committee on Wednesday will complete its drafting of legislation to revamp the American health care system, the first of three major health care bills to be voted out of committee.	https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/blogs/15thecaucus-senate-h33323.html	The Senate health committee on Wednesday will complete its drafting of legislation to revamp the American health care system, the first of three major health care bills to be voted out of committee and a significant achievement for Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the acting committee chairman. Mr. Dodd has been filling in for his friend, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who is battling brain cancer. And at various points, it seemed that Mr. Kennedy's illness had really slowed the committee's efforts to draft a health care overhaul. The committee vote, expected at 10 a.m., is expected to be strictly along party lines with Republicans unanimously in opposition. The bill includes a provision that would create a government-run health insurance program to compete with private insurers, which Republicans have generally said is a deal-breaker for them. The Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has said the government-run health insurance is a Trojan horse for a fully government-run system and would drive private insurers out of business. A trio of committees in the House -- Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means -- on Tuesday unveiled the full draft of their health care legislation and they are now ready to begin the public mark-up process of considering and voting on committee amendments that Mr. Dodd's panel has completed. The House legislation also includes the creation of a government-run health insurance plan. Lagging behind is the Senate Finance Committee, whose chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, has been working hardest to develop a bipartisan bill that would win the support of Republicans on his committee. Mr. Baucus and Democrats on his panel are scheduled to meet again Wednesday morning, and a meeting of top negotiators from both parties are set to meet later in the afternoon. The Finance Committee has the primary responsibility for deciding how to pay for the roughly $1 trillion, 10-year cost of the health care overhaul, and there has been serious disagreement internally among Democrats and between Democrats and Republicans over the best way to do that. A plan by Mr. Baucus to tax some employer-provided health benefits effectively collapsed last week when the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and other party leaders said that there would not be sufficient support for that idea among Democrats. Mr. Baucus and Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said on Tuesday that negotiators were narrowing their focus on a menu of smaller revenue-generating ideas and hoped to reach some agreement in the days ahead. President Obama has been prodding lawmakers to pick up the pace and the pressure on Mr. Baucus is certain to escalate once Mr. Dodd's committee has approved its bill. Mr. Obama has said he would like the health care bills approved in the House and the Senate before the summer recess begins in August, so that the rival measures can be reconciled in conference in the fall. Mr. Dodd's hearing begins at 9:30 a.m. and only the acting chairman, and Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the senior Republican on the panel are expected to speak.	2009-07-15T13:32:46+0000	None	Blogs	Web Log	521
4575	Nancy Horanâs second historical novel reimagines another tempestuous love story.	https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/books/review/under-the-wide-and-starry-sky-by-nancy-horan.html	Nancy Horanâs first novel, âLoving Frank,â explored the tangled personal life of Frank Lloyd Wright. Now, in her second, she takes a deep, long look at the intimate history of yet another creative man. This time, the action is viewed from two perspectives â those of Robert Louis Stevenson and (even more so) of his American wife, Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne, who hopes to be a painter or a writer herself. âUnder the Wide and Starry Skyâ is at once a classic artistic bildungsroman and a retort to the genre, a novel that shows how love and marriage can simultaneously offer inspiration and encumbrance, especially when the more successful partner believes that, as far as artists go, âa family could tolerate only one.â The Stevensonsâ story is full of morbidity and sacrifice, chronicling losses and gains â and, of course, the writing of classics like âTreasure Island,â âDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hydeâ and âKidnapped,â none of which, Horan suggests, would have been possible without Fanny Stevensonâs careful nurturing of her husband.	2014-01-17T16:37:53+0000	BookReview	Books	Review	946

4608	Innovators push clean-burning stoves that can improve health and limit climate impacts.	https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/blogs/19dotearth-stoves-d2837.html	(Photo: Adam Ferguson for The New York Times One of various clean-burning stoves developed to reduce harmful pollution from hundreds of millions of cooking fires in poor countries.) My article last week looked at how replacing primitive stoves with cleaner alternatives in the developing world could have big benefits for climate as well as local health and welfare. Because traditional cookstoves burn their fuel (wood and dung) incompletely. they produce a large amount of black carbon - a k a. soot. Soot cuts short the lives of more than 1.5 million people (mainly women and children) each year. Fuel gathering requires hours of sometimes hazardous work, also mainly by women and children.   And soot is emerging as a major climate warmer. New studies suggest soot is second only to CO2 and has particularly damaging climate effects in the Arctic and on Himalayan glaciers. When the particles settle out in these regions, the black carbon makes snow and ice darker, which in turn warms the ice. That, of course, contributes to melting.  But what kinds of new cookstoves might fit the bill - cheap, low in emissions, fuel-friendly and acceptable to local residents? The Surya project, which I mentioned in my article. is currently testing six models, evaluating their climate benefits and local acceptance.   One design from India is pictured above. Other groups that focus on design with health, development and the environment in mind are pursuing this challenging task as well. I've heard from a number of them in the last few days. One solution that has recently gained some international recognition is the Kyoto Box, a solar-powered cooker. You can check it out on YouTube here.     Last week The Financial Times selected the Kyoto Box as the winner in its FT Climate Challenge, over 300 other entries. It costs about $6 and is mostly made from cardboard.   The company that makes it is planning a rollout in 20 countries over the next few months. Of course, as my hosts in India noted, solar cookers are fine for things like stews, tea and rice. But they don't work very well for some traditional foods, like the flat breads that are best cooked over fires. So other researchers are working with new cookstove technologies that use fire, but much more efficiently.  Professors from Colorado State have spun off a company called Envirofit International, to engineer cleaner stoves for the developing world. They have several different fuel-burning options, all of which drastically reduce emissions and soot. The company has received a $25 million grant from the Shell Foundation to build and disseminate millions of their cookstoves.  It may well be that no one alternative is right for every country and every cuisine. Just as in the developed world, the favored cookstove may be a matter of personal preference. 	2009-04-19T15:19:42+0000	None	Blogs	Web Log	466

Usually, they are under the loving supervision of a friend or relative, supported by a fast-growing network of health-care professionals who make house calls.   Experts who study the interaction between body and mind say that home health care fosters a greater sense of wellness and provides the opportunity to remain as independent as possible and involved with life. In general, patients heal faster, feel better and may even live longer when cared for in a home setting.   As more Americans do live longer, and as the number of frail and sick elderly Americans continues to grow, the need for this kind of alternative to long-term institutional care becomes more pressing. For some patients who cannot afford or find placement in top-quality nursing homes, supervised care at home is the only option.	https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/22/garden/health.html	MORE and more Americans who might once have spent months or years in hospitals or nursing homes are today being cared for at home.

4666	  To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years. The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join toether in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the ture cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy. THE OVERSEER A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators ofthe quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising questions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive. THE PAYERS Employers: Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in thier region, and to support family coverage for married workers. Employee: Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments. Self-Employed and Nonworkers: Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible. Government: Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances. Large Corporations: Would have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums. THE BROKERS Health Alliances: The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for services provided outside H.M.O.'s Access: All citizens and legal resident would be covered. Cost: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range. Eligible Plans: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements. Options: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is overshubscribed. Quality: Allance would publich information to help consumers compare the service and the medical perfomance of various plans. Size: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Structure: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance Corporate Alliances: If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their won alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employees might have fewer providers to choose from. THE OPTIONS Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service options offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,932 a year for an individual and $4,360 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in price; people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies, covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars. H.M.O.: The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subsribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay a share of the bill. Combination Plan: The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits. Fee For Service: The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family) and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. THE BENEFITS All Americans would be issued a health security card that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below. Dental: Most care for children. Adult preventive benefits phased in by 2000. Drugs: Prescriptions Eye & Ear: Routing vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only. Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year. Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days. Hospice Care: For terminally-ill people. Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary. Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays. Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance. Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices, when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents futher deterioration. Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illness or injury. Re-evaluated every 60 days. Preventive care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening. Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services. The plan excludes services that are not medically necessary or appropraite, citing cosmetic orthodontia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services. A Consumer's Guide: How Different Groups Would Be Affected   IF YOUR SITUATION IS... Working, with Good Insurance: Many employees would see little difference, especially if they have already joined an H.M.O., and some would have more plans to choose from. Workers opting for free choice of doctors would often pay more up front toward premiums and have higher costs as theyreceived care. Companies would be required to pay 80 percent of average premium costs, but could pay more if they wished. If currently offered, company-sponsored benefits behond those in the standard package remian tax-free to employee for 10 years. Working, Uninsured: Employers would be required to contribute and employees would be required to purchase coverage, paying 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium, less if they chose a cheaper one. Workers would receive a subsidy toward their share, on a sliding scale, it family income is below 150 percent of the poverty line. The poverty line in 1992 was $14,340 for a family of four; 150 percent of that is $21,500.) Non-Worker or Unemployed: Those with little income would pay little to keep full coverage; those with uneraned family income would contribute on a sliding scale, paying full cost if income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty line. Part-Time Worker: Employers would contribute toward premiums for those working from 10 hours to 30 hours a week on a prorated basis. Depending on total family income from all sources and eligibility for subsidies, workers pay the remainder. In general, those who have purchased individual policies in the past would benefit from cheaper large-group rates. Self-Employed: Self-employed individuals would pay under a complex formula that treats them like a small business, potentially eligible for subsidies, and an employee. As contribtuion toward the employer share - 80 percent of average premium cost - they would pay from 3.5 percent to a maximum of 7.9 percent of business income, depending on income level. They would also pay employee's 20 percent share, or less if family income was below 150 percent of poverty. Combined payments would approach full cost of premium at income of about $30,000. All premium payments would be tax deductible, compared with 25 percent now. Two-Earner Family: In most cases entire family would sign up for same plan, but spouses may be allowed to join different ones. Each of the two employers would contribute toward each earner, but the two earners together would not pay more than the normal family share - 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium. Whether most families would pay more or less than now depends on many factors. Household Employee: For those working more than 10 hours a week and considered an employee by Social Security, employer would make a contribution based on wages, ranging from 3.5 percent of annual wages under $12,000 to 7.9 percent of $24,000. Employees would pay the remainder with subsidies for families below 150 percent of the poverty line. Early Retiree: Initially, early retirees not yet eligible for Medicare would have guaranteed access to insurance at community-wide rates. Beginning in 1998, the Government would pay 80 percent of the cost of an average premium for all but the most affluent people. Part-time work or a spouse's earning would alter this subsidy. Medicare Recipient: The elderly would continue to receive the same benefits, plus new prescription drug and home-care coverage. States have the option of bringing Medicare beneficiaries into health alliance, but only if benefits equal or are better than current coverage and a fee-for-service plan is offered. Monthly premiums would rise, especially for affluent retirees. Once alliances are established, people turning 65 have option of remaining in their former health plan, paying any differnce between Medicare contribution and plan cost. Medicaid Recipient: Poor people on Medicaid would receive mainstream medicine, signing up for a plan through the alliance. In most cases the Federal and state government would make set payments to the health plan, rather than paying providers on a per-service basis with a fee schedule as in the past. Recipients could choose any plan with premium at or below the regional average without making additional payment. Student: Students attending school full time in a distant location, but covered under their family's policy would sing up for coverage through the alliance where they attend school. A Portion of family and employer premium payments would be transferred from the home alliance to the alliance providing coverage. Illegal Immigrant: Illegal immigrants would not be eligible for coverage through the health alliance but could still receive emergency and other care as they do new.	https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/clinton-s-health-plan-a-new-framework-for-health-care.html	To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years.

Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance Corporate Alliances: If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their won alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employees might have fewer providers to choose from. THE OPTIONS Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service options offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,932 a year for an individual and $4,360 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in price; people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies, covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars. H.M.O.: The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subsribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay a share of the bill. Combination Plan: The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits. Fee For Service: The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family) and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. THE BENEFITS All Americans would be issued a health security card that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below. Dental: Most care for children. Adult preventive benefits phased in by 2000. Drugs: Prescriptions Eye & Ear: Routing vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only. Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year. Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days. Hospice Care: For terminally-ill people. Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary. Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays. Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance. Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices, when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents futher deterioration. Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illness or injury. Re-evaluated every 60 days. Preventive care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening. Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services. The plan excludes services that are not medically necessary or appropraite, citing cosmetic orthodontia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services.

4667	  HEALTH insurers are adopting increasingly sophisticated computer programs in their struggle with doctors over procedures and fees. The newer programs create records called physician profiles, which insurers and health maintenance organizations cite to influence, reward or dismiss doctors in their discount networks.   The profiles are based on a physician's behavior in a series of cases -- what X-rays and diagnostic tests were ordered and whether the treatment was in line with the insurer's rules. The insurers use the results in selecting doctors whose work is considered cost effective and high in quality.	https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/18/business/business-and-health-software-controls-on-health-costs.html	HEALTH insurers are adopting increasingly sophisticated computer programs in their struggle with doctors over procedures and fees.

4674	  All Americans and legal residents would be guaranteed a package of minimum benefits that would continue despite any illnesses or changes in employment. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE   A range of services would be covered, including hospital care, emergency services, doctors and other health professionals, pregnancy-related services, hospice and home health care, ambulances, outpatient laboratory tests and prescription drugs. The Administration describes the coverage as equal to that offered by the nation's largest companies.    A new long-term care program would be created for disabled people that would provide expanded home care services.    Coverage of dental, eye and mental health care would be initially limited, but be expanded in the year 2000. Items considered not medically necessary, like cosmetic surgery, would not be covered.   Free preventive care, including periodic medical exams, immunizations and screening procedures like mammograms, pap smears and readings of cholesterol levels would be provided in accordance with a schedule set by the Government.    A Medicare benefit for prescription drugs would be created. Beneficiaries would pay 25 percent of the program through their Part B premium, a $250 deductible and 20 percent of the costs beyond that to an annual maximum of $1,000.    A choice would be offered between enrollment in a traditional fee-for-service plan, a health maintenance organization or a plan that combines elements of each.   Employers would be allowed to provide benefits that are more generous than the standard package, although after the year 2000 the extra benefits would be treated as taxable income for employees.    Illegal immigrants would not be covered, although they would continue to be eligible for emergency and other services; institutions that serve many uncovered patients would continue to receive Federal reimbursement. HOW IT WOULD WORK    Most Americans would be enrolled in regional entities called health alliances, which would negotiate the price of coverage with health plans, offer a range of plans to members and collect premiums from employers and individuals.    States would insure that alliances exist in areas where coverage would otherwise be insufficient.    Companies with more than 5,000 employees would have the option of providing care to their workers by creating a corporate alliance and contracting directly with a health-care provider.    People now enrolled in Medicare would continue in that program, but could later join the regional alliances. States would have the option of integrating Medicare recipients into their alliances so long as their coverage is as good or better.    Medicaid recipients would be enrolled in regional alliances and receive the standared package of benefits, as well as supplementary services.    All Americans would be issued a national health identification card that would guarantee them access to needed services. WHO WOULD PAY    The average premium for the standard package would be $1,800 a year for individuals and $4,200 for families. Businesses would be required to pay 80 percent of the average premium. Families and individuals would pay the difference between that amount and the full cost of the plan they select, meaning that those enrolled in cheaper plans would pay less, or more for plans more expensive than the average. Employers would have the option of paying more than 80 percent. The plan also suggests that a worker would be able to buy an average health policy for just $360 a year and a family policy for $840. The employer would pay four times that much.    No business in a regional alliance would have to pay more than 7.9 percent of its payroll. Companies with fewer than 50 employees and those with many low-wage workers would be eligible for Government subsidies and for caps ranging from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll, depending on their average wages.    Families and individuals could pay their share of the premium directly or through withholding; alliances may require withholding to avoid bad debt.    The self-employed and unemployed would be responsible for the entire amount of the premium, unless they were eligible for assistance based on income.    Retired workers under 65 would be responsible for 20 percent of the premium.    Employers would pay for part-time workers on a pro-rated basis.   Out-of-pocket costs would depend on the kind of service chosen. Alliances would be required to offer high-cost, low-cost and combination plans. The terms appear to refer respectively to traditional fee-for-service coverage, HMO's, and preferred provider networks.    A high-cost plan would allow the use of any doctor but calls for deductibles of $200 an individual and $400 a family and 20 percent co-payment after that.    In a low cost plan, the patient would see only doctors approved by the plan, but pay no deductible besides a $10-a-visit fee for outpatient services.    In the combination plan, the patient would agree to pay 20 percent of the cost whenever using a doctor outside the plan.    Out-of-pocket expenses are capped annually at $1,500 for each person and $3,000 for a family under all three plans. CONTROLLING COSTS    A National Health Board would be created to oversee the system and set a national health budget with the goal of limiting the rate of increase of health care spending to that of the general rate of inflation by 1999. Health care expenses are now growing at more than twice the inflation rate.    If the competitive process does not reduce growth to that level, the board would impose mandatory limits on the growth of annual premiums, forcing health plans to spend less.    Upon introducing the plan, the President would urge all sectors of the health care industry to limit price and spending increases to a specific amount not yet disclosed. Prices and spending would be monitored by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.    The National Health Board would make public declarations about the costs of new drugs and could investigate the costs of existing drugs it considers overpriced. It would have no authority to set drug prices.    The rate of increase of Medicare and Medicaid would be reduced. WORKERS COMPENSATION    The separate insurance systems that now exist to cover the costs of injuries suffered at work or in automobile accidents would be continued. But the care would be provided through the health alliances created under the plan through contracts between them and the insurers. TAKING EFFECT    States could begin implementing the system by Jan. 1, 1995, and would be required to have it in place by Jan. 1, 1997.	https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/11/us/clinton-s-health-plan-highlights-of-the-clinton-health-plan.html	All Americans and legal residents would be guaranteed a package of minimum benefits that would continue despite any illnesses or changes in employment.

4683	  THE special pain of being a fat child in a world that worships thinness is hard for many adults to appreciate. Although a significant percentage of overweight children are not unhappy and participate unimpeded in normal childhood activities, many others suffer the censure of their peers, their parents and even themselves.   They are the last to be chosen on teams, if they are chosen at all, and many have trouble making friends and participating in typical youthful activities. Classmates readily refer to them as fatso, blob or tubby. The resulting loneliness and idle hours simply add to their problems. With nothing better to do, they sit home and watch television and, yes, eat.   Parents may exacerbate the situation in one of two ways. Some encourage overweight children to eat more than they should by using fattening foods as bribes and rewards for desired behavior and by leaving such foods around the house as a constant source of temptation. Other parents undermine their children's already shaky self-image and self-control by nagging them about bad eating habits and by registering disgust over the youngsters' size. Feeling unloved and unwanted, many such children drown their unhappiness in even more food or use food as a means of controlling their parents: defying the parents to stop them from eating what they will, thereby perpetuating the vicious cycle.	https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/18/garden/health.html	THE special pain of being a fat child in a world that worships thinness is hard for many adults to appreciate.

4692	  To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years. The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join together in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the true cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy. The Overseer A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators of the quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising quesions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive. The Payers EMPLOYERS Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in their region, and to support family coverage for married workers. EMPLOYEES Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments. SELF-EMPLOYED AND NON-WORKERS Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently, only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible. GOVERNMENT Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances. LARGE CORPORATIONS Woudl have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums. The Brokers HEALTH ALLIANCES The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for service provided outside H.M.O.'s. ACCESS: All citizens and legal residents would be covered. COST: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range. ELIGIBLE PLANS: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements. OPTIONS: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is oversubscribed. QUALITY: Alliances would publish information to help consumers compare the service and the medical performance of various plans. SIZE: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Large cities would have one alliance. STRUCTURE: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance. CORPORATE ALLIANCES If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their own alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employeees might have fewer providers to choose from. The Options Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service option offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,800 a year for an individual and $4,200 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in prices; people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars. H.M.O. The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subscribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay 40 percent of the bill. Combination Plan The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits. Fee For Service The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. The Benefits All Americans would be issued a health security card that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below. Dental: Preventive care for children. Adult benefits phased in by 2000. Drugs: Prescriptions. Eye & Ear: Routine vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only. Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year. Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days. Hospice Care: for terminally-ill people. Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary. Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays. Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance. Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices. when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents further deterioration. Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illnes or injry. Re-evaluated every 60 days. Preventive Care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening. Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services. The plan excludes services that are not medically necessary or appropriate, citing cosmetic orthodntia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services. A Consumer's Guide: How Different Groups Would Be Affected Working, with good insurance Many employees would see little difference, especially if they have already joined an H.M.O., and some would have more plans to choose from. Workers opting for free choice of doctors would often pay more up front toward premiums and have higher costs as they received care. Companies would be required to pay 80 percent of average premium costs, but could pay more if they wished. If currently offered, company-sponsored benefits beyond those in the standard package remain tax-free to employee for 10 years. Working, uninsured Employers would be required to contribute and employees would be required to purchase coverage, paying 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium, less if they chose a cheaper one. Workers would receive subsidy toward their share, on a sliding scale, if family income is below 150 percent of the poverty line. (The poverty line in 1992 was $14,340 for a family of four; 150 percent of that is $21,500.) Nonworkers or Unemployed Those with little income would pay little to keep full coverage; those with unearned family income would contribute on a sliding scale, paying full cost of premium if income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty line.  Part-time workers Employers would contribute toward premiums for those working from 10 hours to 30 hours a week on a pro-rated basis. Depending on total family income from all sources and eligibility for subsidies, workers pay the remainder. In general, those who have purchased individual policies in the past would benefit from cheaper large-group rates. Self-employed Self-employed individuals would pay under a complex formula that treats them like a small business, potentially eligible for subsidies, and an employee. As contribution toward the employer share -- 80 percent of average premium cost -- they would pay from 3.5 percent to a maximum of 7.9 percent of business income, depending on income level. They would also pay employee's 20 percent share, or less if family income was below 150 percent of poverty. Combined payments would approach full cost of premium at income of about $30,000. All premium payments would be tax-deductible, compared to 25 percent now.  Two-earner families In most cases entire family would sign up for same plan, but spouses may be allowed to join different ones. Each of the two employers would contribute, and each earner, but the two earners together would not pay more than the normal family share -- 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium. Whether most families would pay more or less than now depends on many factors. Household employee For those working more than 10 hours a week and considered an employee by Social Security, employer would make a contribution based on wages, ranging from 3.5 percent of annual wages under $12,000 to 7.9 percent of $24,000. Employees would pay the remainder with subsidies for families below 150 percent of the poverty line. Retiree, under 65 The Government would subsidize retirees not yet eligible for Medicare. If not covered by former employer or pension plan, they could get coverage through the alliance and pay only 20 percent of the cost of an average premium, as though they were employed. Part-time work or a spouse's earnings would alter the subsidies. Medicare recipient The elderly would continue to receive the same benefits, plus new prescription drug and home-care coverage. States have option of bringing Medicare beneficiaries into health alliance, but only if benefits equal or better current coverage and a fee-for-service plan is offered. Monthly premiums would rise, especially for affluent retirees. Once alliances are established, people turning 65 have option of remaining in former health plan, paying any difference between Medicare contribution and plan cost.  Medicaid recipients Poor people on Medicaid would receive mainstream medicine, signing up for a plan through the alliance. In most cases the Federal and state governments would make set payments to the health plan, rather than paying providers on a per-service basis with a fee schedule as in the past. Recipients could choose any plan with premium at or below the regional average without making additional payment.  Student Students attending school full-time in a distant location, but covered under their family's policy, would sign up for coverage through the alliance where they attend school. A portion of family and employer premium payments would be transferred from the home alliance to the alliance providing coverage.  Illegal immigrants Not eligible for coverage through the health alliances, but could still receive emergency and other care as they do now.	https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/nyregion/clinton-s-health-plan-a-new-framework-for-health-care.html	To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years. The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join together in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the true cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy. The Overseer A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators of the quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising quesions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive. The Payers EMPLOYERS Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in their region, and to support family coverage for married workers. EMPLOYEES Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments. SELF-EMPLOYED AND NON-WORKERS Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently, only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible. GOVERNMENT Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances. LARGE CORPORATIONS Woudl have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums. The Brokers HEALTH ALLIANCES The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for service provided outside H.M.O.'s. ACCESS: All citizens and legal residents would be covered. COST: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range. ELIGIBLE PLANS: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements. OPTIONS: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is oversubscribed. QUALITY: Alliances would publish information to help consumers compare the service and the medical performance of various plans. SIZE: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Large cities would have one alliance. STRUCTURE: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance.

4756	Jane E Brody Personal Health article on health hazards of excess dietary iron; warns people should not take iron supplements or consume too much iron-rich foods unless they have iron deficiency; notes researchers are concerned about widespread use of vitamin C supplements, which can enhance absorption of dietary iron when both are in gut at same time; cites indications that excess iron in tissues can promote coronary artery disease and growth of latent cancers and infectious organisms; diagram; table (M)	https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/05/us/personal-health-922943.html	GENERATIONS of Americans have been exhorted to eat spinach or liver for the iron that supposedly made Popeye's muscles bulge or to take iron-rich tonics like Geritol to revive their 'tired blood.' But while some iron in the diet is critical for health and life itself, the overconsumption or overabsorption of this well-known mineral is now under intense scrutiny as a possible cause or contributor to killer ailments like heart disease and cancer as well as serious infections.	1997-03-05T05:00:00+0000	National Desk	U.S.	News	1127
4757	Residents in Douglaston, Queens, have been swimming at Douglas Manor Beach for more than 50 years.	https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/nyregion/12floating.html	Most summer afternoons, the âFloating Headsâ show up like clockwork. That is the affectionate nickname for the dozen or so older swimmers of Douglas Manor, a neighborhood in Douglaston, Queens, overlooking Little Neck Bay. With the help of canes and walkers, they proceed gingerly out on the pier and lower themselves into bay water so murky and brown that only their heads can be seen floating around the swimming area; thus, their name. 	2008-08-12T02:48:06+0000	Metro	New York	News	839

Yet surprisingly few people, including those who are otherwise health-conscious, get their eyes checked regularly. A thorough eye examination every two or three years is considered adequate for people under 50 with no known visual problems. But for people older than that, most experts recommend an annual checkup that, in addition to assessing visual acuity, tests for disorders like glaucoma, cataracts and macular degeneration, all of which become more common with age and can cause severe visual impairment.	1997-07-09T05:00:00+0000	National Desk	U.S.	News	1062
